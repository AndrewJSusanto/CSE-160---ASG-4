Objectives:
    - Create a virtual world using textured cubes
    - Perspective camera with movement


First person camera (user) starts in a given position within a 32x32x4 voxel based 3D world.
User navigates using the keyboard and/or mouse to move and rotate camera
    - World fully generated on application start
    - Ground created with a large plane (square) or top of a scaled cube
    - Walls are created with cubes
        - Walls have varying heights in units (1, 2 cubes, etc)
        - Faces of the cubes should be textured to appear as a Walls
    - Sky is created with a very large blue cube that is placed at the center of the world
    - World layout should be specified using a hardcoded javascript 2D array
        - Each element of the array represents height of the wall placed at that location
            - ie. at [1][2] the value is 3 -> A wall of height 3 is at [1][2]
    - Camera controled by keyboard
        - WASD controls with QE turning
Additional reqs:
    - Camera mouse control 
    - Add multiple textures
    - Simple adding and deleting blocks on cursor
    - Add animals to the world 
    - Change ground plane from flat to a terrain mapping OR get obj loader working
    - Add a story/game to the world


3A Portion:
    - Have ground created with a flattened cube and sky from a big cube: 0.5 pts
    - Texture working on at least one object: 1 pts
    - Texture on some objects and color on other. Objects working together: 0.5 pts
    - Multiple textures: 1 pt.

0. Webserver
1. Create a new attribute variable to store UV coordinates
2. Load texture from the filesystem
3. Pass the texture to the fragment shader
4. Mix base color with texture color

5. Include both view and projection matrices in your vertex shader
6. Create a camera class to store and control both view and projection matrices
7. Set view matrix using keyboard input
8. Add ground
9. Add skybox 
10. Add Walls



3A Goals:

1. Have the ground created with a flattened cube and sky from a big cube
2. Texture working on at least one object done
3. Texture on some objects, colors on others done


1 is finished, 2 is finished, 3 is finished.

3B Goals:

1. Implement camera movement
    Done
2. Key commands for rotation (Q and E for pan L/R)
    Done
3. Perspective Camera implemented
    Done
4. World is implemented that you can walk around (interesting enough)
    Done
5. Rotate camera with the mouse
    Done
6. Add and delete blocks
    Doing
7. Add simple story or game to the world (1 pt)
    Maze where you "delete" (collect) blocks and return them to the elephant
8. Performance checks
    Difficulty but single walls instead of multilevel cubes
9. Wow factor (0.5 pt)
